You might require Fril for your Mac/PC<br>


1. The attachment (exe) is for windows.<br>
2. The Zip file is for Mac.<br>

It runs in the Terminal Window<br>

To use fril library files (e.g. the trace package) you need  the environment variable FRLIB set to the frilLibrary folder.<br>

In the worst case this can be done within fril by<br>
?((setenv frlib "<full path to fril library>" ))<br>

It's a bit dated now in terms of interface etc - but still passes all the tests !
